### Explanation of Log Templates:
1. **Error Messages**: Highlight critical failures that directly impacted the system's ability to process payments.
2. **Warning Messages**: Indicate developing issues such as resource exhaustion or degraded performance metrics.
3. **Info Messages**: Provide context about system state changes, such as capacity adjustments or load balancing activations.
4. **Debug Messages**: Include granular technical details useful for root cause analysis, such as specific request IDs, payloads, and SQL queries.

These logs can be used by engineers to correlate events, identify bottlenecks, and implement both immediate mitigations and long-term solutions."
