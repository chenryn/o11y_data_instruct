"Below are log message templates formatted in **log4j style** that would appear around the incident time (`2023-10-15T10:00:00Z - 2023-10-15T11:30:00Z`). These logs include error, warning, info, and debug messages from affected components.\n\n---\n\n### **Error Messages**\nThese logs indicate critical issues observed during the incident.\n\n```log\n2023-10-15T10:05:00Z [hostname=data-processing-node-01] ERROR [component=data_processing_engine] Memory allocation failed for task ID 12345. Cause: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded.\n2023-10-15T10:10:00Z [hostname=report-generation-node-02] ERROR [component=report_generation_module] Failed to generate report for dataset XYZ. Error: Task timed out after 300 seconds.\n2023-10-15T10:20:00Z [hostname=decision-support-node-03] ERROR [component=decision_support_system] Query execution failed for user request ID 67890. Reason: High latency detected (>5000ms).\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Warning Messages**\nThese logs highlight developing issues before they escalate into critical problems.\n\n```log\n2023-10-15T10:02:00Z [hostname=data-processing-node-01] WARN [component=data_processing_engine] Memory usage has exceeded 85%. Current usage: 87%. Triggering garbage collection manually.\n2023-10-15T10:08:00Z [hostname=hdfs-storage-node-04] WARN [component=hdfs_storage_service] Disk I/O latency is increasing. Average write latency: 250ms (normal range: <100ms).\n2023-10-15T10:15:00Z [hostname=user-center-node-05] WARN [component=user_center] Response times for authentication requests are rising. Median response time: 1200ms (normal range: <500ms).\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Info Messages**\nThese logs capture system state changes or events relevant to the incident.\n\n```log\n2023-10-15T10:00:00Z [hostname=data-processing-node-01] INFO [component=data_processing_engine] Starting batch processing job for dataset ABC.\n2023-10-15T10:12:00Z [hostname=core-system-node-06] INFO [component=core_system] Resource reallocation initiated due to high memory pressure on data processing nodes.\n2023-10-15T10:30:00Z [hostname=security-auth-node-07] INFO [component=security_certification] Authentication service restarted to mitigate performance degradation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Debug Messages**\nThese logs provide detailed technical insights for troubleshooting purposes.\n\n```log\n2023-10-15T10:01:00Z [hostname=data-processing-node-01] DEBUG [component=data_processing_engine] Heap memory statistics: Used=7.8GB, Committed=8GB, Max=8GB. GC count: 15, GC time: 4500ms.\n2023-10-15T10:06:00Z [hostname=hdfs-storage-node-04] DEBUG [component=hdfs_storage_service] Block replication factor adjusted to 3 for file /data/transactions/2023-10-15/part-00000.\n2023-10-15T10:18:00Z [hostname=decision-support-node-03] DEBUG [component=decision_support_system] Query plan optimization skipped due to insufficient resources. Query ID: Q12345.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Logs**\nThe logs above reflect the following key aspects:\n1. **Error Messages**: Highlight failures such as memory allocation errors, timeouts, and query execution issues.\n2. **Warning Messages**: Indicate early signs of trouble, such as high memory usage, increased disk latency, and rising response times.\n3. **Info Messages**: Capture system state transitions like job starts, resource reallocations, and service restarts.\n4. **Debug Messages**: Provide granular details about memory usage, garbage collection activity, and query execution plans.\n\nThis structured logging approach ensures comprehensive visibility into the incident timeline and aids in root cause analysis."
