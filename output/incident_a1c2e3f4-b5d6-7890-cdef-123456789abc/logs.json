"Below are log message templates formatted in **log4j style**, including timestamps, hostnames, severity levels, and component tags. These logs represent the events surrounding the incident described in `###enriched_incident###` and align with the observed behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Error Messages from Affected Components\n```plaintext\n2023-10-15 08:15:00Z [hostname-db01] ERROR [DatabaseService] - Connection pool exhausted: Maximum connections (100) reached. New requests will be blocked until resources are available.\n2023-10-15 08:20:00Z [hostname-regulatory01] ERROR [RegulatoryReportingSystem] - Task execution failed for job ID 12345 due to timeout while waiting for database response.\n2023-10-15 08:25:00Z [hostname-db01] ERROR [DatabaseService] - SQL query execution aborted after 60 seconds.

Info Messages Showing System State Changes\n```plaintext\n2023-10-15 08:00:00Z [hostname-db01] INFO [DatabaseService] - Database service started successfully. Initial connection pool size set to 50 out of max 100.\n2023-10-15 08:30:00Z [hostname-regulatory01] INFO [RegulatoryReportingSystem] - Regulatory reporting system paused all pending tasks due to upstream dependency issues.\n2023-10-15 09:00:00Z [hostname-db01] INFO [DatabaseService] - Manual intervention initiated: Terminated 20 idle connections to free up resources.\n2023-10-15 09:20:00Z [hostname-regulatory01] INFO [RegulatoryReportingSystem] - Restarting failed tasks following resolution of database connectivity issues.\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Debug Messages with Relevant Technical Details\n```plaintext\n2023-10-15 08:02:00Z [hostname-db01] DEBUG [DatabaseService] - Connection request received. Active connections: 75, Idle connections: 10, Pending requests: 15.\n2023-10-15 08:17:00Z [hostname-regulatory01] DEBUG [RegulatoryReportingSystem] - Attempting to fetch data chunk #45678 from database table 'regulatory_data'.
