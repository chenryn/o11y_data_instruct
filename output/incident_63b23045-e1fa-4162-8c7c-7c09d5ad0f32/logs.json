"Below is a set of log message templates formatted in log4j style, capturing the various aspects of the incident described in `###enriched_incident###` and aligned with potential metric patterns from `###metric_patterns###`. Each log entry includes a timestamp, hostname, severity level, component tags, and relevant details.\n\n---\n\n### **Error Messages**\nThese logs represent critical errors observed during the incident time range.\n\n1. **CDN Cache Miss Error**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:05:00Z [portal-webserver01] ERROR [CDN-Cache] - Static resource request resulted in cache miss. Resource ID: /assets/js/main.js. Frequent cache misses detected, triggering excessive origin fetches.\n   ```\n\n2. **Third-Party Payment Gateway Timeout**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:10:00Z [payment-gateway-proxy01] ERROR [Payment-Gateway] - Transaction request to third-party payment gateway timed out after 10 seconds. Order ID: #TXN123456789. Retrying...\n   ```\n\n3. **Source Server Overload**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:15:00Z [origin-server01] ERROR [Origin-Server] - High CPU usage (95%) due to frequent static resource requests bypassing CDN cache. Response times exceeding SLA thresholds.\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### **Warning Messages**\nThese logs indicate developing issues that could escalate into larger problems.\n\n1. **CDN Latency Warning**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:02:00Z [cdn-edge-node01] WARN [CDN-Performance] - Increased latency observed between edge node and origin server. Average round-trip time: 350ms (normal range: <100ms).\n   ```\n\n2. **Unstable Payment Gateway Connection**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:08:00Z [payment-gateway-proxy01] WARN [Payment-Gateway] - Intermittent connection failures reported for third-party payment gateway. Success rate dropped to 85% (normal range: >99%).\n   ```\n\n3. **Browser Performance Degradation**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:12:00Z [client-analytics01] WARN [Client-Experience] - Elevated page load times recorded for dynamic pages (e.g., order confirmation). Median load time: 8s (normal range: <3s).\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### **Info Messages**\nThese logs reflect system state changes or actions taken during the incident.\n\n1. **Cache Configuration Update**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:20:00Z [cdn-config-manager01] INFO [CDN-Configuration] - Updated CDN cache policy for static resources. New TTL set to 24 hours. Change applied successfully.\n   ```\n\n2. **Incident Resolution Acknowledgment**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:30:00Z [incident-response01] INFO [Incident-Resolution] - Incident resolved. Verified CDN cache hit ratio restored to normal levels (>90%). User experience metrics improving.\n   ```\n\n3. **System Health Check Completion**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:40:00Z [monitoring-dashboard01] INFO [System-Health] - Completed post-incident health check. All systems operational within expected performance baselines.\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### **Debug Messages**\nThese logs provide technical insights into system behavior and troubleshooting steps.\n\n1. **Detailed CDN Cache Hit Analysis**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:03:00Z [cdn-edge-node01] DEBUG [CDN-Diagnostics] - Analyzing cache hit rates. Current stats: Hits=45%, Misses=55%. Top missed resources: /assets/css/style.css, /images/logo.png.\n   ```\n\n2. **Payment Gateway Retry Logic Debug**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:11:00Z [payment-gateway-proxy01] DEBUG [Payment-RetryLogic] - Executing retry attempt #2 for transaction #TXN123456789. Previous attempts failed with HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout.\n   ```\n\n3. **Source Server Resource Utilization Snapshot**\n   ```\n   2023-10-05T10:17:00Z [origin-server01] DEBUG [Resource-Monitoring] - Captured resource utilization snapshot. CPU=92%, Memory=78%, Disk I/O Wait=25%. Investigating root cause of high load.\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### **Log Message Template Summary**\nThe above log messages are structured to align with the following key components:\n- **Timestamp**: Matches the incident time range (`2023-10-05T10:00:00Z` to `2023-10-05T10:45:00Z`).\n- **Hostname**: Reflects logical hostnames for affected systems (e.g., `portal-webserver01`, `cdn-edge-node01`).\n- **Severity Levels**: Includes `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG` based on the nature of the message.\n- **Component Tags**: Identifies specific subsystems involved (e.g., `CDN-Cache`, `Payment-Gateway`).\n\nThis logging approach ensures comprehensive coverage of the incident lifecycle while enabling effective diagnostics and future prevention efforts."
