### **Log Message Template Summary**
The above log messages are structured to align with the following key components:
- **Timestamp**: Matches the incident time range (`2023-10-05T10:00:00Z` to `2023-10-05T10:45:00Z`).
- **Hostname**: Reflects logical hostnames for affected systems (e.g., `portal-webserver01`, `cdn-edge-node01`).
- **Severity Levels**: Includes `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG` based on the nature of the message.
- **Component Tags**: Identifies specific subsystems involved (e.g., `CDN-Cache`, `Payment-Gateway`).

This logging approach ensures comprehensive coverage of the incident lifecycle while enabling effective diagnostics and future prevention efforts."
