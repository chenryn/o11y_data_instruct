### Summary of Log Patterns
The logs above reflect the following key aspects of the incident:
1. **Critical Errors**: Highlighted the failure points in the transaction chain, particularly the expired certificate issue in the second-generation payment system.
2. **Warnings**: Provided early indicators of performance degradation and high error rates.
3. **Info Logs**: Captured state changes, such as the initiation of the certificate renewal process and the resumption of normal operations.
4. **Debug Logs**: Offered detailed insights into request flows, SSL handshake attempts, and resource utilization metrics.

These logs can be used to reconstruct the timeline of events, identify root causes, and improve monitoring/alerting mechanisms to prevent similar incidents in the future."
