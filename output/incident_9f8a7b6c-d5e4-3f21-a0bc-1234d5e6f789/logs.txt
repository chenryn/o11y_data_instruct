### **Explanation of Log Templates**

1. **Error Messages**:
   - Highlight critical failures such as timeouts, backend overloads, and transaction failures.
   - Include specific error codes, transaction IDs, and descriptive error messages.

2. **Warning Messages**:
   - Indicate developing issues like increasing latency, dropping cache hit rates, or potential bottlenecks.
   - Provide thresholds and observed values to help identify anomalies.

3. **Info Messages**:
   - Capture system state changes, such as entering peak traffic periods or applying configuration updates.
   - Useful for understanding the context of the incident.

4. **Debug Messages**:
   - Provide detailed technical insights, including payloads, cache operations, and database queries.
   - Essential for root cause analysis and troubleshooting.

These log templates align with the incident's timeline (`2023-10-15T14:30:00Z - 2023-10-15T15:15:00Z`) and reflect the technical characteristics described in the enriched incident data."
