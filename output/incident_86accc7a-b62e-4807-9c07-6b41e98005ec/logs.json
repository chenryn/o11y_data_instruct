All systems restored to normal operation.\n   ```\n\n---\n\n#### **Debug Messages with Relevant Technical Details**\nThese logs capture low-level technical insights useful for root cause analysis.\n\n1. **Detailed Database Sync Metrics**  \n   ```\n   2023-10-10T14:09:00Z [hostname=database-primary-01] [DEBUG] [component=DatabaseSync] Replication stats - Binlog position: 12345678, Last event timestamp: 2023-10-10T14:08:50Z, Lag: 12s.\n   ```\n\n2. **API Gateway Performance Metrics**  \n   ```\n   2023-10-10T14:10:00Z [hostname=api-gateway-02] [DEBUG] [component=APIGateway] Performance metrics - Active connections: 500, Average response time: 2.3s, Error rate: 15%.\n   ```\n\n3. **Unified Credit Service Debug Logs**  \n   ```\n   2023-10-10T14:13:00Z [hostname=credit-service-03] [DEBUG] [component=UnifiedCreditService] Validation logic executed for user ID: user12345. Missing field: 'available_limit'.\n   ```\n\n4. **Client-Side Interaction Logs**  \n   ```\n   2023-10-10T14:14:00Z [hostname=frontend-app-01] [DEBUG] [component=Frontend] User interaction log - Loan submission failed after 3 attempts. Error code: SYNC_DELAY.\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Log Patterns\nThe above templates are designed to align with the incident timeline and severity levels:\n- **Error logs** highlight direct causes of failure.\n- **Warning logs** flag potential issues before they escalate.\n- **Info logs** document system state changes and recovery actions.\n- **Debug logs** provide granular technical details for deeper analysis.\n\nThese logs can be integrated into monitoring tools like ELK Stack, Splunk, or Prometheus for real-time alerting and post-mortem analysis."
