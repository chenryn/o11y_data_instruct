### Summary of Log Patterns
The above templates are designed to align with the incident timeline and severity levels:
- **Error logs** highlight direct causes of failure.
- **Warning logs** flag potential issues before they escalate.
- **Info logs** document system state changes and recovery actions.
- **Debug logs** provide granular technical details for deeper analysis.

These logs can be integrated into monitoring tools like ELK Stack, Splunk, or Prometheus for real-time alerting and post-mortem analysis."
