"### Log Message Templates for Incident Analysis\n\nBelow are log message templates formatted in **log4j** style, including timestamps, hostnames, severity levels, and component tags. These logs cover error messages, warnings, info messages, and debug details around the incident time.\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Error Messages from Affected Components**\nThese logs represent critical failures observed during the incident.\n\n```log\n2023-10-01T08:05:00Z [file_transfer_service] ERROR [primary_server] Disk space exhausted on primary_server. Temporary file write failed for file /tmp/regulatory_data_20231001.dat. Disk usage at 98%. (metric: Disk Space Usage)\n2023-10-01T08:10:00Z [database_sync_service] ERROR [eth0] Network bandwidth exceeded threshold (95%). Data synchronization for regulatory_reporting_db delayed by 2000ms. (metric: Network Bandwidth Usage)\n2023-10-01T08:15:00Z [regulatory_reporting_system] ERROR [primary_server] Failed to process incoming files due to upstream dependency failure in file_transfer_service. Regulatory reporting task aborted. (metric: File Transfer Service Errors)\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Warning Messages Indicating Developing Issues**\nThese logs highlight warnings that could have been used to detect issues before they escalated.\n\n```log\n2023-10-01T07:55:00Z [file_transfer_service] WARN [primary_server] Disk space usage approaching critical threshold (85%). Immediate action required to prevent service disruption. (metric: Disk Space Usage)\n2023-10-01T08:02:00Z [database_sync_service] WARN [eth0] Network bandwidth usage increased to 80% during peak hours. Potential risk of data backlog in regulatory_data_queue. (metric: Network Bandwidth Usage)\n2023-10-01T08:08:00Z [regulatory_reporting_system] WARN [primary_server] Increased latency detected in database sync service (1200ms). Risk of missing SLA for regulatory reporting tasks. (metric: Database Sync Latency)\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Info Messages Showing System State Changes**\nThese logs capture state changes or operational updates during the incident.\n\n```log\n2023-10-01T08:12:00Z [file_transfer_service] INFO [primary_server] Manual disk cleanup initiated. Removing temporary files older than 7 days to free up 15GB of disk space. (metric: Disk Space Usage)\n2023-10-01T08:20:00Z [database_sync_service] INFO [eth0] Network configuration adjusted to prioritize regulatory_data_queue traffic. Bandwidth allocation increased by 20%. (metric: Network Bandwidth Usage)\n2023-10-01T08:30:00Z [regulatory_reporting_system] INFO [primary_server] Regulatory reporting task re-triggered after resolving upstream dependencies. Task status updated to \"In Progress\". (metric: File Transfer Service Errors)\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Debug Messages with Relevant Technical Details**\nThese logs provide detailed technical insights for root cause analysis.\n\n```log\n2023-10-01T08:03:00Z [file_transfer_service] DEBUG [primary_server] Temporary file write attempt failed for file /tmp/regulatory_data_20231001.dat. Error code: ENOSPC (No space left on device). Disk usage: 98%. (metric: Temporary File Write Failures)\n2023-10-01T08:07:00Z [database_sync_service] DEBUG [eth0] Detected network congestion on interface eth0. Current bandwidth usage: 95%. Queue size for regulatory_data_queue: 150MB. (metric: Data Backlog Size)\n2023-10-01T08:25:00Z [regulatory_reporting_system] DEBUG [primary_server] Database sync latency reduced to 600ms after network adjustments. Remaining backlog size: 50MB. (metric: Database Sync Latency)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Logs\n- **Error Logs**: Highlight critical failures such as disk exhaustion, network congestion, and task abortions.\n- **Warning Logs**: Provide early indicators of potential issues, such as high disk usage or increased latency.\n- **Info Logs**: Capture operational changes, such as manual interventions or system adjustments.\n- **Debug Logs**: Offer granular technical details for root cause analysis, including specific error codes and metric values.\n\nThese templates align with the enriched incident details and metric patterns provided, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the incident timeline and contributing factors."
